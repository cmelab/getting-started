# Welcome to the Jankowski Lab!
## [Click Here for the Wiki](wiki/README.md)

You're currently reading a README file for a repository hosted on github.com.
Cool!
The Jankowski lab uses lots of repositories to manage code, write papers, and even provide an introduction to the lab itself.
This particular repository has two main components, the first of which is the [wiki](wiki/README.md) which should be your first stop if you're just getting started.

The second component to this repository is code stored in this repository for configuring software tools that we commonly use.
Don't worry about this code right away: Head over to the [wiki](wiki/README.md) to learn what a repository is, how to get the code stored in it, and how to run it on your computer (if necessary).
Having these configurations isn't mandatory, and if you like something else, feel free to change or not use them.

To install all of our configuration settings, clone this repo, navigate into the config_files directory of this repository, and run:

```bash
make
```
