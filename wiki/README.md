# Welcome to the Jankowski Lab #
Also known as the Computational Materials Engineering Lab (CMELab), our lab uses statistical mechanics and computer simulations to solve problems for societal good. The theme of the lab is *efficiency*.

Page needs some description and pointers of the *science* we do. Also need some framing for how to think about projects.
