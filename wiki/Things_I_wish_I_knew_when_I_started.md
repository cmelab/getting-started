* You learn by doing. 
* Always celebrate the small wins. 
* If you get stuck on a problem for more than an hour, don't be afraid to ask for help! 
* It's okay to not know what is going on.
* When in doubt, record everything. You'll thank yourself later.
* File organization/naming conventions are important so think about the big picture/workflow before you start stashing data all in one folder.
* Shell scripts (.sh) are your best friend (especially when you mess up or change your naming conventions).
* Sometimes the quickest way to get out of a rut is to take a little break and do something else for a bit.
