"*Lisa, get in here. In this house, we obey the laws of thermodynamics*" -- [Homer Simpson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc-m9dumEaw)

In this lab, we endeavor to as efficiently as possible improve the world. The mechanisms by which we do this are pretty normal for a research lab: We discover things that will help us make the world better, and we tell those things to the rest of the world. In order to do this as efficiently as possible, we expect:

* Inclusivity. Above all, be nice. See also: [[Code of Conduct]].
* Timeliness. Clocks and calendars are sacred. If you will miss a meeting or deadline, let the appropriate people know, early enough so it won't cause other people problems.
* Making lots of mistakes. Mistakes are how learning happens. Make as many of them as you can, as quickly as possible.
* Learning. Endeavor to make each mistake only once. 
* Documentation. Write everything down. It can be on paper, on wikis, in repositories. When you write down what you learned or what you fixed, it helps you commit it to long term memory, and helps you be able to find your note later. Writing things down is the primary difference between *science* and *goofing off*. 
* Having fun. It should feel a little bit like you're goofing off with the rules of the world, at least some of the time. Don't forget to write down what you learn!
* Sharing. Help others use what you've made!
