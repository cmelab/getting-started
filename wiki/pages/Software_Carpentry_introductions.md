The Jankowski lab is involved with [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/), and we use the bash, git, and python tutorials to on-board into the lab. Note that the tutorials in steps 2-4 are forks of the SWC tutorials that rely on knowledge of `vim`, so they might be less confusing than using the sites directly from SWC.  

* Step 0: If you do not know how to get a command prompt open on your machine, ask!

* Step 1: With a command prompt open, get familiar with vim! The formatting below indicates a command to be run at that prompt:

    ```
    $ vimtutor
    ```


* Step 2: [Bash](https://mse150s17.bitbucket.io/shell/)
* Step 3: [Python](https://mse150s17.bitbucket.io/python/)
* Step 4: [Git](https://mse150s17.bitbucket.io/git/)
* Step 5: [Conda](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/introduction-to-conda-for-data-scientists/)
