1. Read the abstract
2. Look at all the figures and read the captions - make some notes to myself about what I expect to see in the paper: 
 What questions do they care about? What tests did they perform?
4. Read all of the words in the paper in order, without stopping, without trying to understand anything.
5. Read the paper again, this time skipping sections I don't care about, and focusing on the things I find interesting or trying to understand something that popped up in 1 or 2.
