Here we list some of the mile markers that we have experienced and have strived for as we have progressed as scientists. (Qualitatively from easiest to hardest)

#Evan#

Read and understand the science behind what we do.

Go through tutorials and get set up on the clusters.

Learn to use the analysis scripts that have been written: radial distribution function, diffract, autocorrelation.

Play with other group's code and identify where in your workflow it would help: mBuild, Fresnel, Signac etc. 

Write custom analysis scripts (plotting various state points and clustering algorithms).

Master opv_cg (for opv_cg people):

  * Learn the various inputs that can be or need to be used in the input scripts.

  * Create new molecule building blocks and model files.

  * Implement new features into opv.py and cme_utils.

  * Build complete run scripts for specialized systems.
